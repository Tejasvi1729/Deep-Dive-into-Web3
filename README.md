It completely depends upon the model wheter th model is centralizd or not.

In my mode, only 1 bank provides loan and every individual/corporation have to approach that particular bank in order to avail a loan.It maintains a common database and uses same functions to everyone's properties and give loan to them(if they are eglibile). Since only one authority looks over all the banks, it is centralized.

Although a centralized system looks easy to manage and more secure it has some demerits:
1. Failure of the bank will stop all the processes which isn't the case in decentralized systems.
2. In most of the cases, decentralized systems can cover every segment and range of customers while centralized is better for systems targetting lesser variety of customers.
3. Decentralized systems are very easy to upgrade and change while changing a centralized system isn't easy.
4. Due to its large size Centralized systems are more prone to errors and delays.
5. A centralized system is relatively large and powerful thus bringing less transperancy.

There are some merits too:
1. It is relatively easy to setup and allot resources to.
2. Economies of scale make centralized systems to operate efficiently and cost-effectively.
3. In most of the cases, it provides more facilities and features then decentralised systems.

With proper research, decentralised system is replacing centralised systems like blockchain.
